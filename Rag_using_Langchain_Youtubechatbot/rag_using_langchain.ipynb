      "how do you build wealth as an immigrant and turn it into multi8 figures how do you start from zero coming from another country in just a short period of time and that is the topic of the conversation I am having today in this interview with no other than Luke belmare he's somebody that will change the way you think about money completely how you build wealth he's young he's very young but he's very accomplished he's turned the internet and the media World completely upside down receiving over half a billion views per month talking about how to build multiply and and preserve your wealth in this new digital age he came to the US from Argentina at 16 years old with only $200 in his pocket he hustled he grinded his way to a multi8 fig Networth through digital marketing e-commerce and investing and now helps others do the exact same thing through his new group called The Capital Club I had the pleasure of speaking there a few months ago in this interview we get into a lot of topics you need to build grow and protect your wealth we talk about things like how did he build wealth after coming from nothing with it but at the age of 16 $2200 in a suitcase my I asked him about how someone else wanting to follow the same path that he went on would go about making money like he did how can you make money in the beginning Arbitrage sales anything that you can get your hands on we talked about making money we talked about how do we multiply we talked about the Investments I asked him how did he 40x his investments in crypto and what did he do next sell out of crypto rotate the tech stocks it only made sense under undervalued meta undervalued Shopify which are the only two stocks that I truly knew because I run Facebook ads and I run Shopify so I understand the Q4 reports of Facebook and I understand the Q4 reports of Shopify undervalued I wanted to know what his views were on what people should be focusing on to be more successful I spent 20 years getting good at business now I need to spend the next 20 years and that was yet productive and then we talked about how coming from a country like Argentina shaped his view on money crazy part is people need to understand that the money system isn't just just an accounting system it's a it's a tool of power we got into what he thinks about the new president Argentina what he sees as the future of technology business and investing we started out talking about building Community providing value and so much more this is a banger interview you definitely want to get a pen a paper out you want to get ready for a master class on starting from zero and building an empire so let's go all right Luke Belmar how's it going brother man the myth maybe about to be the Legend You're The Legend bro no you're you're you're definitely I'm here in your studio yeah yeah yeah you're definitely the man in the myth though the guy behind the the the curtain I love the I love the scarcity that you do where like you know when you first started hitting me up I'm like I don't even know who this guy is I go look at your Instagram there's like nothing there I look at your YouTube it's like there's no videos there like who is this guy um you do everything very with with scarcity in the mindset um so we're talking about right now we'll just jump right into it we're talking about um your community that you run and talking about how you limit that and create this scarcity for the community and you're talking about how U basically 200 people per day get an invite to join only 369 people of the 2500 actually get in correct if they don't if they don't win the race they're out and they're out for good so you don't want to give them another chance to get back in even though that's certainly hurting your bottom line they missed their chance they missed their chance and that's it because the value extends beyond the money it it has to it you have to build a community Beyond a fin fincial metric right so if you want to build a loyal following and if you want to have a community that [ __ ] with you you have to put them through things that challenge them you can't just hand over everything for free you can't just make everything easy and comfortable because if you don't pay you don't pay attention right and if you get everything for free you're not going to Value it and if you see me all the time then you're going to be to think I'm normal so familiarity breeds contempt the less you see me the better so I limit my content but I maximize my distribution so I figure out what is like a Facebook a winning Facebook ad you can match that same thing with the concept of content creation so you have a winning piece of content perfect that video gets a million views that's a winning piece of content you've proven the thesis does are you only going to limit that video to 1 million views or you going to repurpose that video 10,000 times so in 2023 we posted almost 100,000 videos wow and that is the difference between me and everybody else is with the 100,000 videos I don't have to focus on sending emails I don't have to focus on giving people a second chance because there's always new inflow of individuals that are willing to actually go through the 369 process and sign up before everybody else and join the community and become part of Capital Club all right hopefully you're enjoying this interview with Luke I got to take a very quick break real quick to tell you that I am hosting a live event where I'm going to show you how to seize the upside of the feds U-turn grow your investments in 2024 and sidestep Market volatility I'm going to break down about 20 or 30 chart so you can see the actual data see exactly what you should be doing what you should be watching and so much more I'm going to be not only showing you the information I'm going to be taking all your questions live so join me come hang out live let's get through this data ask me all the questions you have let's plan to get through this together so we can all be on the winning side of this all right let's just jump right back into the interview with Luke if you think about email email is a way one it's a way to own your list right so you talk about rent the list versus own the list so it is a way to own the list if you were to get canceled on all the platform do you have no email list which is a problem but it's also a way to nurture the list and so basically you're saying forget nurturing on email I'm just going to continue to nurture them online yes 100% And you nurture them through short form so long form is when when they know what you're about short form is when they know that you exist so in short form they know that you exist and then the continuous repetition of email is what for you to be in front of people but that doesn't mean you have to be in front of people via email all the time so the question is what do you use the email communication for I began perceiving email completely different than any other digital marketers ever talked about email so I consider myself let's say I have my own Kingdom right back in the day 2,000 years ago Alexander the Great conquered all of the Known World Luke the great he not quite uh but he clearly didn't have the ability the access or the time to go to every single Governor every single point of his Empire and Proclaim his message he had to send what Messengers in this case emails but what were they talking about the word of the king whatever he wanted to transmit it wasn't the messenger cooking up a message via email marketing with with a nice slogan on behalf of the king so every email that comes comes from me I sit down I write it whether it's on my phone whether it's on my notes and I send it to my team so the authenticity level that's attached to the email I don't see it as email marketing I see it as a one-on-one communication with another individual that's why my email open rates with a quarter million follower list is 68% now let's talk about I want to I want to jump back to the beginning but I want to hammer this point home so that's cool for you great job like uh you can not let anybody in 15% of the amount of people in what about people that don't have that many people I mean how would you apply that to something where you know you're trying to get 50 people to join first you need to ask yourself is what I'm building or who I am worth following or worth investing in and it's a candid conversation because you are in a marketplace where there's competitors there's people that are phenomenal there's people that are excellent I mean you're in the finance space you understand your competitors there's dudes out there that are extremely intelligent really competent so you have to get to par be legit to in order to compete at that level so I think initially before even conversing about building a following it's are you worth following right so the reason you have so many followers on YouTube is because your content is [ __ ] phenomenal the reason I reached out to you was because I saw your bis World structure I'm like oh Financial structure okay this guy's quite intelligent now I know what he's about let me go reach out to him and that's because you had substance most people are out here doing [ __ ] stuff online they have no substance so they're not worth following so first is ask yourself do I have a product worth selling that people want and am I somebody worth following if the answer is no then ask yourself who do I have to become in order to become worth following yeah you went through the [ __ ] trenches you went through 8 implosion you went through all the [ __ ] you sold companies you listed companies like you've done the whole nine so now you're in a situation whereby you actually have credibility and street cred and validity to do what to actually be in a situation whereby you can coach you can teach you can build communities you're worth listening to right other people aren't so I think before getting to that stage of hey why don't people listen to me ask yourself am I worth listening to and if the answer is yes now you need to start creating content content around what content around what you know become passionate about it and understand that there's people that are there with you and then when it comes to how much content you need to produce I take a completely different approach than Gary B Gary B says create content content content no no no create limited amount of content that is high quality known to convert and distribute that to everybody that knows who uh or knows this Niche or this community and if they don't know who you are they will and it's a very different approach a very different format because instead of doing this shotgun approach of million pieces of content I'll take one winning piece of content and distribute it to ensure that hundreds of millions of people see it if I know it converts I love that it's uh I know you worked with Andrew Tate and it's sort of the message Andrew Tate has about um getting girls become the kind of guy that a girl wants like don't just be mad about it and so you're kind of saying the same thing about your content like become the kind of person that somebody would be interested in I remember when I I think right right around when I was 20 or so I just had this idea I need to travel the world and the reason why I want to travel the world is I wanted to have a bunch of stories because I want to be interesting and now I've spent I travel a couple months a year I've been doing that for decades now and so it's like uh but that at that time it was like I need to go have experiences so I have things to talk about and so business deals that you do all of those things so it plays in what about um when you talk about the content the Gary ve so Gary ve is like don't create document just document what you're doing and not like hey here's what I'm eating but more like the lessons that you're learning along the way is kind of what I picked up from it but you're talking about like creating content but you create content across a pretty wide Niche or not a niche but really a wide group of subjects everything from stoicism to crypto to creating content to whatever what do you think about starting Niche down Niche your face off if you will the riches are in the niches versus like being so broad like you are so it depends on it depends on the niche that you pick and it depends on your objective so for example my umbrella approach is very simply everything's aligned so if you look the people that are usually involved in stoicism they're also involved in the understanding of Entrepreneurship or they want sovereignty so now the understanding of crypto and Bitcoin could tie into the idea of uh this autonomy and then Bitcoin ties into the concept of principles of being your own Merchant managing your own money that ties into okay now I have freedom of money maybe I want freedom of employment so now you begin to talk about that and now okay well social media who how can I make money online so what I try to create isn't individual niches that are viewed individually I try to create a garden so I create a garden for the community and how I view my community is very different to how most people view it most people view the community as a place where they're going to make money so how I view if it was a if my internet exposure was like a small little Empire in the real world I would consider Capital Club or my community like the Nile River you don't take from the NY River the NY River exists your goal is to preserve it you build your Empire around the NY River so what are the businesses that you're building around the community while nurturing and sustaining the community most people [ __ ] up the community most people poison the river most people destroy it instead of building around it so I have my beautiful Community great people top of top of the top now how can I Empower them so empowering them through different experiences different events different content that I understand because I'm very similar to my audience what I want so I only talk about the [ __ ] that I enjoy because I know we have for example similar interests we could sit down and talk about stoicism Bitcoin crypto and Entrepreneurship and that's it and it's within our Niche and our range so I try to become uh really good at what I like and then share those things to people that are similar to me and it just happens to be that my audience and my choice of enjoyment is large enough and it's becoming the future like e-commerce crypto it's only going to get bigger and we just happen to be at the cusp of it so it works I love what you said about um not taking from the N River just building around it and so I can tell you know the first experience I had was at your Mastermind in Spain um last year and uh you've really built this community of giving more than you're taking so you use the word Empower and that's the ultimate what you're trying to do and you're trying to like really think about how can I cultivate another relationship and it's it's an old sales message which is if I help other people get what they want I think it was Zig Ziggler if I help people get what they want I get what I want and so you're kind of creating this system that empowers people to get what they want and then ultimately then you can get what you want around it and it's a long game and I think most people let me get your comment on this I think most people can't play the long game the majority of people I think are held back because they can't imagine working for free they can't imagine working for free they're used to a paycheck well if someone's not going to pay me every hour I'm not going to go do it and so how am I going to go work for months months and or even years without getting paid hopefully to get it in the end I don't know what your thought is on that uh so you know what I was talking about with with Andrew on the Tesla coming over here in the car and I was like imagine you're in year 200 of the 400 year of uh Israeli slavery inside the Egyptian kind of Empire where you have the the story of Moses or you can even take when Israel gets captured and taken into exile to Babylon you have the story of Daniel what happens if you're born in year 227 of that slavery you have no context of Freedom you have no understanding of what it means to be autonomous you have no reference point of working for yourself you have no reference point of making your own money you have no reference point of sovereign currency because you're under the thumb of your oppressor yeah people don't seem to understand that that's where we are today you're 200 and something years into an ecosystem that's been curated and designed for slavery so when you understand that you're aund and something years into the scop you begin to ask yourself why does it take 10 years 12 years in order for me to buy a house cash that sounds kind of slavish when a couple years ago I just would have to work two three years and before that it would take a couple months what the [ __ ] is a 30-year mortgage now they're trying to come up with 50-year mortgages so I begin to evaluate all these scenarios and I ask myself where the [ __ ] are we going in the future so to get it's not so much an opinionated thing it's more so I like to observe things pragmatically and see them play out uh what I was saying is do you think that holds you're you're taking a very long-term approach okay I'm gonna I'm gonna preserve the Nile and I'm not going to take from it but I know if I build around the n and help people get what I want eventually I'll get what I want and I was saying I think most people are held back by the fact that they can't imagine working for free yes correct so back to the point so if you're in year 176 of slavery and all you know is that you're going to work and in return you're going to get a paycheck then that's the default mindset that you're going to hold no labor is going to be put forth unless you're able to see a reward and most people can't see a reward in front of their like if it's right here if they don't see the dollar sign right here they're not going to do it they have they're risk adverse they don't understand that they have truly nothing to lose but they're not willing to take any risk so I think the big discrepancy as to why individuals aren't willing to take the risk or why individuals are in a situation where they have this kind of potentially slave mindset to me has to do with nurture how they grow up the school system how they're educated and overall I think it's a cultural experience of hundreds and hundreds of years of systemized cheating that's been done on people to extort them for their time their energy and their effort if you look at how the Fiat system was created it wasn't created to empower people it's created to steal from people so if you begin to realize that this is kind of like a slavery model that's imposed on everybody you can kind of shake away from it or at least observe it from a third party perspective it may be beneficial yeah let's jump back to the beginning of Luke Belmar so from what I know from your story you're some poor little kid from Argentina that came to the United States with 100 bucks in your pocket 200 200 bucks in the pocket um you know a lot of what we become is from where we came from and so a lot of that is cultural educational and I mean today right now in the United States we're seeing millions of people coming up from Venezuela and Argentina and South America coming up and I don't think they have the same mindset as you so I'm curious what was that like uh why did you come up up here and how did you come up here with 200 bucks and like how did that work out yeah so age of 16 I graduate from high school thankfully my parents put me in an English speaking school it cost $300 a year so I was able to learn not the colloquialisms and the specificities of English I think I I adopted this I've I've also been in America for over a decade at this point I'm 28 been arrived when I was 16 so I was able to learn the language and uh get quite eloquent uh with it but at the age of 16 $200 in a suitcase my parents uh got me well they they get they didn't get me a flight my one of my family members was actually working for the airline Argentina Airline and I was able to get a flight attendant spot so wherever the flight attendant seat sit I think I think in Spanish it's called a yam seat or something like that I don't know what it's called but that's where I sat and then I had family members in the US stayed with them worked all sort of odd jobs pressure washing basketball courts cleaning toilets flipping Wings flipping pizzas and then in the year 201 and of 15 2016 my first exposure to anything digital was I had a fellow server you I was working a restaurant 2015 and he was like hey have you heard of Bitcoin that was the first Bo remember that was the first kind of the 15 16 it was that's when I got in it was it was peeking but I was like this is expensive I don't know what this is Bitcoin is a couple hundred bucks I couldn't really afford it but you know what let me take a couple dollars and put them on bitstamp but I wasn't really part of crypto but that was my first exposure to anything internet 2016 came around got exposed to everything that was e-commerce I said hey I'm going to go Liv with my brother $200 a month that's what I paid him for rent to sleep on his couch and I built my first online business which was selling and reselling online digital assets what was uh Instagram Pages building those accounts selling them uh what was Facebook ads for different how did you how did you figure out that you want to buy and sell Instagram accounts because people were willing to do it so for example people would hit me up and they would but did you have like a friend that was doing it so you're like everybody was doing it this was when this was the craze of the meme Pages back in the day it was when the meme Pages were going crazy so people would build up a niche of a meme page and then they would grab an e-commerce store run some Instagram story ads to it boom milk it go to another page what I would do is just build up the pages a little bit and then sell the pages to Ecom guys or build people's Pages sell them to them flip Instagram usernames anything that could do hustle make money online so on that in in that regard I think a lot of people are caught up today and I got to find my passion I don't know if this is what I want to do is this what I was made for and it's like dude sometimes you just got make money how much how much money is there in digital Arbitrage it's insane no I I get it but the point I'm making is I think so many people are paralyzed with inactivity because they don't know what they want to do and I'm guessing and you tell me if I'm wrong but I'm guessing this wasn't like your dream calling in life it was like hey there's an opportunity confucious once said if you do not economize you will agonize so it's very true you it it's people are like oh I need to be a business owner no you don't need to be a business owner to make money you just need to make money right becoming a business owner is high risk you're the last one to get paid brother like you're the last everybody gets paid here whether the the business works or not the video editor is still getting paid everybody's getting paid but we're not so how can you make money in the beginning Arbitrage sales anything that you can get your hands on so you just saw an opportunity like hey I see people doing this I'm just going to jump in and figure it out just jumped in and that's the piece that I want to hit so many people are paralyzed with fear because they don't know what they want to do and it's like just start making money you don't know what you want to do until you start doing things that you don't like last year I made millions of dollars doing coaching programs and I decided I didn't like them but I wouldn't know that until I had done them right um and so we we've changed that but um I think that's a good point um okay so keep going so now you're you're flipping those things but I think one of the important parts of this entire narrative that I want to hone in is that my expenses were so low and my risk wasn't built up with having things family bad decisions of the past where I limited the amount of risk or the amount of opportunity I would Pursuit I was only paying 200 bucks to sleep on my brother Nate's couch right like that's what I was paying I had nothing to lose I wasn't married I didn't have kids I don't have any of these things so anything that I do is full-on business fullon risk everything all in because I could afford it and what I think for young people is never put yourself in a situation where you make irreversible decisions it's one of the most important principles I learned so from a young age I never made decisions or took action towards things that I could not reverse that would fundamentally change my life path and I think that was my most important lesson like having kids out of wedlock at the AG of 17 that [ __ ] up your life yeah okay for some people it's an anomaly and they end up being super successful but for the average individual that's an irreversible decision so what do you do with that irreversible decision you have to deal with it so my objective was don't make irreversible decisions make decisions that if anything happens you can pivot from right so low risk High reward low expenses and then I got a marketing gig so I started doing marketing ads for Wall Street businesses so companies in Wall Street I would do their ads because they weren't running Facebook ads so I got my first check for about aund for $86,000 for N9 months of work wow did running Facebook ads doubled the company's Revenue I did it for free for two months I was doing out outbound because I would get DMS from them on Instagram or LinkedIn messages like hey like if you're interested in our products or servic like this is [ __ ] let me add some ads to them yeah ran it for two months for free I called them like hey guys I want a contract like oh no no I we'll think about it next month I was being nice turned off their ads the next day next morning they called me hey can you fly up to New York yes yeah they gave me my check and I called my dad and I was like I made it and he's like bro 80,000 9,000 that's crazy like I'm like yeah but it's not enough but remember I was paying $200 a month yeah for rent so now and it's US Dollars and you're coming from Argentina and it's crazy so now I'm making this money and I'm like what do I what can I do with my advertising skills because I was still n it's this is a 9month gig I don't know if these guys are going to renew I don't know if they're going to keep on going most agency work is quite laborious these people are calling me I'm like let me move this money let me try some other things let me take my Facebook ad skills what am I going to do e-commerce figured out the entire ecosystem of e-commerce Drop Shipping now arbitraging physical products not just digital products we ended up doing in the span of 3 years 16 million in Revenue which isn't massive numbers but it is for teenagers Y and we ended up flipping and putting all our money into crypto which I know sounds insane but it only makes sense because crypto's the future and yeah we rode the 2020 Bull Run and we 42x uh our portfolio so quite fire yeah I love I love what you said I want to break a couple pieces down for the for the listeners here so um if you look at the World of Sports let's just say you want to be a pro whatever baseball player to think that hey uh I'd love it if the Dodgers would sign me a contract and I'm going to go learn how to play baseball and I'm going to be really good baseball player for you like no no no no you got to do it your whole life and you have to be good enough that they give you the contract so what you said was sort of like that like you went and learned how to do digital marketing you went and learned how to build Instagram social media flip those and only once you had learned those skills on your own for free working for free spending your own time effort labor then you got good enough to make a little bit of money then you went and gave those services to a company for free to prove your net worth and only once you had proved enough worth they were willing to pay you for that sort of like getting a contract from the Dodgers but people today think that they can just go hey will you give me a job to do marketing for you but you got no marketing skills and that goes back to the question I had posed earlier about people not wanting to work for free but we play sports for free and so it's just this mindset shift that really holds people back so I kind of want to highlight that I think to add and to finalize that point is if you always want to make money you have to be Irreplaceable if you have to be Irreplaceable and you have to be in high demand so I made sure that I was Irreplaceable what did I do for this online company doubled their online Revenue in two months yeah so now I was Irreplaceable and I was in high demand so now I had the leverage and I think in business it's all about leverage you leverage Yourself by becoming better and people are like oh well they leverage themselves through blackmail or through finessing no no the ultimate form of Leverage is to become so undisputably good that people call you right you give your services for free until they want to pay you until they demand to pay you uh yeah I love that okay so now you put all your money into crypto because you're young and you're low risk and you figure you might as well bet it all you already said that's kind of how you grew up and so at this point you're still young your expenses are still low now you know how to make money so now your risk tolerance is higher because now you know you can go make more money if you need to and you don't have the downside risk so now you throw it into crypto uh you time the market cycle pretty good you 40x 42x your portfolio you crush it then what sell out of crypto rotate the tech stocks it only made sense under undervalued meta undervalued Shopify which are the only two stocks that I truly knew because I run Facebook ads and I run Shopify so I understand the Q4 reports of Facebook and I understand the Q4 reports of Shopify undervalued right Q4 they [ __ ] rip their sales through the roof so in q1 reporting every single year look at the meta stock yeah every single q1 it rips through the moon so I rotated out of crypto which I felt like it wasn't at the value that it was supposed to represent I think it was overvalued I rotated to undervalued assets this case meta Shopify Robin Hood coinbase micro strategy and my only one that I'm still waiting to play out which will play out is Paypal yeah I mean Facebook sold off 75% which is ridiculous like you think it's going to go away 75% so like yeah what a what an undervalued stock all right I'm going to take another very quick break right here I'm not running commercials in these so these are my commercials but I want to let you know I'm having this live event so we can seize the upside in the feds U-turn that's coming and grow our investments this year without dealing with the volatility it is going to be a volatile year things are going crazy so come join me we're going to look at the data we're look at the charts the graphs and I'm going to show you what I think is going to happen more importantly what we should be doing about it how we can position ourselves what assets we should buy what we should be watching and so much more come hang out check it out it's all for free I'm going to answer all your questions live there's a link down below let's go I'm curious so now um you've you''ve cut your teeth making money create wealth so you and I we actually say the same three things different words but create wealth multiply wealth yes preserve wealth and most people don't understand those three um and so your journey was creating wealth what can I do pressure wash basketball courts flip pizzas I'm creating wealth I'm earning wealth flipping um Instagram accounts creating wealth then you have to go to multiply it so then you throw into crypto you multiply it 40 times right and now you have to preserve it I'm just curious like how you think about those three buckets as far as your attention and time focused into that so um how much time do you really think about your growing creating the wealth through businesses versus like managing it multiplying that wealth so it depends so on the business side there's two aspects one is instant cash flow so I can do a Consulting call for $10,000 but let's say just like Luke Belmar so 90% of my time is focused on my business and growing my wealth and spend about five or 10% of my time with like what my money is doing when i'm not earning it or like what what does that look like yeah so I I would say the breakdown isn't like a specif a specific breakdown of time it's more so a breakdown of of my life patterns so the the life patterns in the business side it breaks down to active income and it breaks like what I have to work for directly versus money that comes in so I'll create content Capital Club will continue printing subscriptions I'm need to create the content regardless so that income just comes comes in I have my entire team I have my CEO Steve tan I have my entire organization there's almost 100 employees inside Capital Club that build manage that structure I don't need to be there every single day I spent the last four years building that so now it's in a place where it consists in itself simply because I've created the other vehicle of content creation so content creation feels this that's more so like my passive stream of consecutive money so I'm not really focused on this besides the product right because if it's my vision I need to ensure that the product sustains itself and I'm focused on community retaining people then on the active income side it would be like I don't do coaching but if there was a coaching experience right so if you do coaching you can that's your active income that would be money you receive right away I don't do a whole lot of that I don't Focus really on instant money because I've made money you know once you scratch that that that that itch of okay I don't no longer need to eat I think people need to change their mindset from Hustler to boss and I think people start making millions they don't change their mindset right it's the same mindset that they had when they had nothing you can't have the hungry mindset when you're already full makes no sense you're that becomes gluttony because now when you have a lot you have to begin to share right and and if you want to scale you need to bring people in so now my main focus is recruitment right so now I focus on looking for talent and looking for opportunities so now that my main basket my Nile River is being nurtured and taken care of I'm bringing new content new eyeball to build out the ecosystem if I choose to I can have some sort of active income that requires me to dedicate specific hours but I don't necessarily like to do that and most of my time now is focused on looking for new projects Business Development and recruiting top tier talent because if you can recruit top tier Talent all you have to do is let them work and get out of their [ __ ] way yeah like the recruiting Talent we're going to talk about that but let's just go back to it for a minute so um I often say that the lines between business owner and investor are very blurred in my career right when I was out of high school I started buying bank owned properties fixing them and flipping them and I did over a hundred of those properties was I a real estate investor or was my business buying and selling houses uh I have 100 Grand in my bank account I could just go buy Bitcoin or I could hire a new employee to go do business development for me am I investing into my business or am I business right so like the blind the lines are very blurred and I just want people to get an idea of this because it's something that I see so I talk about investing right I run investment newsletters and things like that and the majority of people I would say come into my universe and they have a th000 bucks and they want to quit their job and be a full-time investor and I'm just like whoa whoa whoa that's not how it works like Warren Buffett still goes to work every day a business called birkshire haway Ray alio still goes to a business Bridgewater Capital right so it's like you need to have the business and then you invest into it so that's why I was kind of curious what your thoughts were on that and so you know I think about and Alex rosi's talked about the S&P me right so it's like I asked my buddy the the day we were down in Mexico together over New Years and I said you know if you were going to put $100,000 into the S&P 500 you know the historical average of the last 60 years about 75% on that if you so if you put 100,000 in S&P you make 75% if you put 100,000 into your business to hire a new business development manager do you think they could bring you back more than $7,000 and he said yeah I think so I'm like so then why don't you do it I guess I never thought of it but the point because they don't because they don't see the employees as an investment they only see it as a salary and when you're paying for an employee you're investing into them time energy paycheck attention so your goal isn't just for them to do the job my employees dude I sit down with them and I tell them this is this is how you can scale in the organization this is how this is your growth pass this is your growth trajectory I sit down and have real conversations with them as like hey if you work well this is the future that you can potentially have within the organization so it's not just okay giving them the vision of here's a paycheck but now adding to it it's now they're part owners now they feel like they're part of the vision now they feel like they're part of the mission and now the the the focus becomes a little bit different yeah and to the point that you made earlier like people they don't reinvest back into themselves right so it's like they were hustling hustling hustling they made the million bucks or whatever it was couple hundred grand whatever that number is for you but then you don't make the shift to then being an investor in your own business so I make the 100 Grand or the million bucks and then I want to go put it into whatever I'm going to put it into but then I don't invest back into the business so then the business doesn't continue to grow right something like that I think about like the mindset shift the difference and actually I was with one of my uh one of my portfolio companies I was coaching last night and we were talking about this specifically and how they're going to close uh on the phone sell their s the product and I said the difference of a poor mindset and a rich mindset is is a poor mindset thinks about the cost and the rich mindset thinks about the value so would you buy this used iPhone for $5,000 well if you only think about how expensive it is you wouldn't but if I said but my Bitcoin Wallets on here with 100 Grand do you want to give me five grand now right and so that's sort of like the mindset shift that people have to go through like um thinking about the value that I'm going to get um not spending my time investing my time not spending my money but investing my money and not and back into the business for that growth so I think it's an important point to hit really create create create wealth and and it's understanding that you don't have to make money every single day every moment of the day to be productive it only a only a fool would plant a seed and watch it and be angry and observe it the same day grow [ __ ] grow mother no the world has a natural process there's an e there's an EB and Flow To Nature you are part of nature you cannot go beyond universal law there's a time and a season for everything so there's a time and a season for harvesting and there's a Time season for sewing right so where when are you sewing if you're sewing it'll eventually come to you what people don't seem to understand is the success that you enjoy today isn't from today's actions it's from the accumulation of all the past seeds and then people end up losing in the future yeah that's because you slacked off today because you're focused on the rewards from the past thinking that you're eating them and indulging on them today when in fact you're just indulging from past performance and if you leave idleness in the present moment your future's going to get [ __ ] yeah so it's like how can you and that's the TR that's the super trap right you start accumulating wealth you start making money and you start slowing down slowing down slowing down slowing down slowing down because you're your your attachment and your value and your uh perspective of what it means to be high performance or productive is attached to dollars but there's so many things in life that transcend dollars that you can focus on your health your nutrition your family I was SP I was speaking to a guy that had done over a billion dollars in real estate real estate sales made a [ __ ] ton of money in commercial real estate he said I spent 20 years getting good at business now I need to spend the next 20 years learning how to become a good father so it's like his Focus changed completely because he realized that to become a complete man to become a full successful individual there were other areas that he had to work on and spend time energy and attention that weren't going to yield necessarily net dollars but that were still part of his development and his process and that was yet productive yeah yeah most personal development would tell you there's at least three and usually four categories of your life that you need to work on and uh that would be like health wealth your business right that'd be your relationships and then the third fourth one that people throw would be like your own spirituality like where you're at with that and really if if all four three or four aren't worked on together then they hold you back so for example I'm really good with making money and I spend a lot of time with my family but I'm 300 lb and I'm sick and I'm tired so then I don't have the mental Clarity or the energy to do as well in business or with my family as I could so if I got my health up then my business and health would grow if I if I'm really healthy I'm in the gym all the time I to make a bunch of money but my relationships are crap that holds me back because I don't have that support network behind me yes and so really you want to keep all of those going together and they multiply each other lonardo Da Vinci famously said to develop a complete mind study the science of Art and study the art of science yeah learn how to see realize that everything connects to everything else then he continues to say he says God will sell you all things at the price of work God will sell you all things at the price of Labor so first you need to understand that everything connects to everything else so how you treat your wife how you treat your kids it's going to it's it's going to reflect how you treat your employees how you treat the waitress how you cheat in business or how you're loyal in business it's going to be a reflection as to everything else that you do so to develop a complete mind is to understand that everything is in unison everything is in Harmony and to not be in Harmony in one area is to be dysfunctional in everything it's like having a toothache being ripped six pack tan [ __ ] great physique but you have a toothache yeah everything is miserable so unless you develop a complete mind in full focus and understand that God will give you anything but you have to work for it you have to you have to exchange and transmute this energy and this life power in this life will into creating materializing something into into the universe into the physical world it's going to take labor but you have to do it with unison in completion if not you're not going to win yeah I love that I've never heard that quote I wrote it down I'm G to go look it up but I talk about everything has a cost to to the point that you're making and uh the everything will uh you can sell all God will sell you everything at the price of your work so the cost to get what you want is going to be your time typically uh your time your labor your effort energy things like that and you could say well the cost to getting in shape is I have to join the gym and I have to go to the gym I have to dedicate time and attention to that um but also uh there's a saying that says either um either you sacrifice things today to get what you want or those things become the sacrifice yes so one way or another it's going to it's either going to cost you my time today or it's going to cost my future dream and that principle of God will sell you all things at the price of Labor led me to the belief excuse me led me to not the belief because belief entails religion or a system that you can't see it made me realize the power of Bitcoin why now this is a complete flip but when God sells you all things at the price of labor labor represents energy and put so the system the machine that we talk about this if you're born year 200 in the slavery machine you don't know what being free or using your own autonomous energy to create things for yourself looks like so now you're in a situation whereby you're using your energy to create things that don't belong to you so for example you have this money that's printed out of thin air there is no energy right input that sustaining the US dollar how many people we printed $6 trillion who worked what type of energy was input to print that money none none but what about the money right that was printed through energy that becomes devalued the money doesn't become devalued what becomes devalued your energy your energy that you've put in dollars as a value of energy now is being slowly trickled and depleted so what happens God can't sell you all the things at the cost of Labor if you're in the Fiat system because the energy right whatever God wants to pay you is slowly being taxed or slowly being filtered out so that led me to if I'm going to get anything in life at the cost of my life force energy so I need to take my life my energy and materialize it into something whatever I materialize it into has to be able to sustain its energy and has to be able to sustain its if I if you pay me $110,000 today for a phone for a phone call or a consultation call and I put it in the bank today I would be able to redeem that $110,000 for something completely different than what I would be able to redeem that $10,000 in 10 years if it was in Fiat if it was in Fiat so it's not that my money's worth less it's that my energy is worth less because my energy can now not no longer purchase what it used to so that led me to believe to find something that requires energy for existence Bitcoin requires literal physical energy input for existence so what you're buying from Bitcoin you're not buying Bitcoin what you're buying is a immutable storage of perfect energy right I I love that and we talk about that on a philosophical level a lot which a lot of people think is n n new new stuff and we don't need to pay attention to it but if you don't really understand this then you don't understand the whole key behind life and so the law of energy is that energy cannot be created it can only be transferred yes so uh we have food which gives me calories calories are measur measurements of energy and then I expend those calories by thinking by working by doing I'm spending my energy my life if you will and then let's say that I'm working for 4 hours to earn enough to live for that day but then one day I decide to work an extra four hours well then I want to save that extra energy in something that I could then choose to spend tomorrow so I don't have to work and then the goal so that's sort of like your life battery if you will right and the goal is that that battery holds its charge you don't want that to lose power but to your point the Fiat system is like a battery that's like uh if you've ever gone uh like up in the mountains where it's it's cold like your batteries they die real quickly right so like you have this battery that's losing and and Bitcoin is a different type of battery that can hold that energy and it's your life it's like literally your life as a matter of fact I just put out a tweet a couple days ago now that I got my Twitter account back um talking about um inflation increased the cost by $32,000 so for the average worker at $32 an hour which is the medium pay it was taking them about 300 extra hours per year to have the same quality of life that they had the year before so 300 hours per year of your life that's your life that you could be in the gym getting in shape with your kids teaching them lessons with your wife building your relationship 300 hours of your life your energy expended for the same thing that was last year yeah and what I came to realize is we were talking about going back to the creating part multiplying and preserving of wealth the multiplication Factor people need to realize I need to stop expending my time and my energy for that's the process of building Gardens or ecosystems where money works and makes itself is it no longer requires time and energy to make it if we go into the Louis Vuitton store and I go with somebody that makes $1,000 a month they're going to look at a Louis Vuitton wallet that's worth $500 differently than me because to me $500 it didn't require any time energy or attention for me to make it this person it required 3 weeks of time and or two weeks of time energy and attention so they'll value the wallet in direct proportion to the amount of effort and labor that it took them to produce what the necessary energy to purchase that wallet right so now I'm no longer in the premise of is this cheap or is this expensive how much energy and LIF span and time did it take me to acquire that thing because you don't buy things in life hear me clearly you don't buy things in life with money money you buy things in life with the time that it takes you to make that money so the objective of multiplying your wealth is to be in a situation where you no longer work for money but you work towards creating systems that create money giving you the freedom so that you can use your energy to do what you want in life yeah let me ask you about this if you think about um money I say that we don't want money nobody wants money what we want is the goods and services that money buys us but if you think about money for example it's like a exchange of value it represents value exchange so I could say hey Luke let me come over to your house and help you move this weekend or hey let me come build a fence for you or let me paint your house or let me build a website for you if I as a friend were to say hey I'm going to help you move this weekend then I would have built Goodwill with you and you would sort of owe me a favor back right we're not going to write it on paper but like maybe you would help me do something a social a social credit a social credit right so then really by me providing you value it's sort of like a favor and now you give me and I owe you that you owe me a favor some value in the future but that's like a barter system so if we want to scale past the barter system then we need something a sort of IOU that I could go to give somebody else so the dollar sort of represents an IOU so I've built you a fence I helped you move you give me an IOU that's recognizable it's a medium exchange to get other favors from other people yes and if you think about that philosophically then I'm going to say something people don't like to hear and that means that if you're broke you're kind of selfish how much Goodwill have you put into the world how many IOU slips are you sitting on in that barter environment if I helped you move and you move and you move and I built you a fence and you a website and I collected all these favor IOU statements the person that had the most amount of favor IUS you would say man that guy's really generous because you get paid in proportion to the value that you provide Bingo and the thing is the marketplace will pay you in proportion to that so if you have no value to provide it's either you don't know how to provide value or nobody can see the value you can provide because either you don't showcase it or or it's just not there I agree fully yeah it's interesting way to look at it when you look at it from a philosophical angle let's talk about it now from like a more of a we'll stay on the philosophical but let's look at it from like a freedom Angle now I've often said many times and I strongly believe that there is no freedom without the freedom to transact and really it starts with the freedom of private property so back to me being able to store my value store my energy that's my first form of private property do I store it in dollars or Bitcoin or gold or do I store it in a in a in a ranch with cows however I decide I want to store that that's my life batteries that's my property and if you take that cow from me or take my money from me that's my life you're literally stealing it um but then the freedom starts with being able to control the private property but then more importantly be able to transact and so we see today that the the governments of the world want to continue to impede that ability for us to transact freely and I'm curious your point uh or your point of view coming from Argentina so uh Argentina is sort of the textbook example today of uh sort of a society breaking down and hyperinflation where people couldn't even hold their money anymore and as I was with you and your team in Spain last year I was told that I wasn't really aware of this like you're not even allowed to spend much of your money so I think you're not even allowed to spend do you have X amount of dollars that you can withdraw per month but I I think uh maybe it was YY from your team said like you couldn't even spend more than $300 a month on your credit card you couldn't because uh or or they would exchange at a very high rate 700 to one or something like that right so like they wouldn't even allow you to spend your own one well they wouldn't allow you to spend your own money Capital controls lock you in and then they would just continue to steal from you and the crazy part is people need to understand that the money system isn't just just an accounting system it's a it's a tool of power so when when when when the coinage was created for example 700 a year 700 uh around BC 700 I think it was in turkey that was the first introduction of the coin right so coin just like Bitcoin it's not money it's technology it's technology of what the rip mitts of value that's all it is so the coin was the standardized remittance of value from A to B I could actually move it how do you how do you make a cow divisible right if I want to sell you a ranch and it's going to cost me 19.5 cows it makes no sense cuz now I have half a cow worthless so it's no scalability in that in that idea so now I have money and as soon as money came into the in the side of like coinage you begin to S see Barons Kings people that could actually hold currency and had some sort of uh in this case back in the day it would be Army that could sustain their sovereignty uh you would do quite well with coinage the issue with coins is that they began to uh get de debased so they introduced metals that would debase the currency so for example Rome let's say they conquered the entire known world and they had no more kingdoms to conquer therefore no more gold production therefore no more economic growth so they had to debase the currency the issue with that is that now you no longer know what's legit you no longer know what's false remember how there's like this there's this verse in the Bible that says that God abhor the the misbalanced by units it was measured by weight so everything had to have a fair balance now we have the introduction of the Fiat system which was initially a physical representation of the gold it was I exactly now that IOU got overprinted [ __ ] now the government got into bed with this entire scam I iie the introduction of Bitcoin which goes back to the bartering system but with the technological advancement of no middleman necessary what happens in society especially with governments is the new technological advancement produces a temporary period of time of sovereignty so when coinage came new Barons Rose new Sheiks Rose new Zars came into Power new money same thing happened with the radio as soon as the radio was introduced into the house one of the one of the big criteria was for the government to control every single outlet on the news which was the source of technological transformation the radio as soon as the internet came we had a few years of what internet Freedom where people could look up information see all the details boom then censorship you had that technological period of Boom where people got free and now you're in a situation where you had social media come into play social media came into play they censored social media really deeply but now you have the cracking of social media so people there's technological advancements that produce what Freedom so if you look at the etymological uh use of the word to think or thinking it was extremely popular pre-introduction of the radio in the household so people used to think freely prior to the government coming into the house as soon as the radio came into the house you can look up the eological use of the word and the popularity of it to think thought freedom of thought the moment the radio was introduced into the house that use of word went down people stopped to think when did that word begin to emerge again the moment the the internet became placed in the house so a seek of freedom and truth and thinking once again now you have the introduction of new technology which is what Bitcoin on the monetary side which is what the disruption of the financial system that we've been under for the last 100 years so now people are waking up and there oh there's something else whether Bitcoin is the future or not is not relevant what happens is that Bitcoin showed that there is another way of transacting outside of the now controlled technology of remittance now we have a decentralized form of remittance that gives us the ability within a few years before they have digital IDs and ID me and all this garbage to access the internet a few years to become extremely wealthy in this period of time because we have this technological differentiator so if people understand technolog technology frees you and then technology gets controlled and Technology frees you again and technologically gets technology gets controlled your job is to figure out what's the next pocket of technology I can take advantage of for my next power play so if you look at the future what are you going to need you're going to need autonomous AI that runs off of your script not off of somebody else's scripts you're going to need uh unmanned machines that work specifically for you that's the technological advancement that's part of the future so money in my opinion will eventually become obsolete when I have Bots when I have robots when I have ai working for me half of the jobs are not going to be commercially viable maybe it's not 10 years 20 years but in 50 years we will get there so money will no longer be valuable so what will money be and that's where the question becomes store of value and things of this nature but technology is always evolving always moving but always comes down to the transactions of goods and services well I guess it depends on what you considered money I mean if I think of money as a medium of exchange we're always going to need a medium of exchange yes so money is not going to go obsolete what we know as money and what we even consider value will change crazy so value will change just like information changed back to your point before radio and even in the 80s information was what I got on the nightly loser in my morning newspaper today I see a kid in Thailand post a picture on the beach and I see what the water looks like I see the temperature so like all this information that wasn't there so I think value changes but humans are always going to exchange yes we're always going to exchange that's what capitalism is in my book The Uncommon Manifesto we really kind of honed in on that specifically which is capitalism is not a political modality it's human nature so capitalism is private property using it more efficiently and free trade among others I have a fire you kill the rabbit hey cook your rabbit on my fire let's just share that right and the beauty of Bitcoin is that it lets you do that at scale at scale multi- border without being present with a with a money type that people internationally accept as a form of value which is incredible and it's never happened before which is the fascinating part about Bitcoin that I absolutely love I'm curious your standpoint on this because you came from Argentina where the money's wrecked like literally impoverishing people right and you also you travel the world so you talk with a global audience if you will do you think that helped you understand why we need a non-government money like Bitcoin better um then most people in in the US who were like what do we need different money for I grew up in a small town it's not a village a small town of 12,000 people I would go to my local steakhous a small little steakhous five different tables one server cook on an Argentine Style Grill the Argentine peso to the dollar I remember the time I was 11 years old uh buying my my dad took me took me to that Steakhouse and it was a I think it was a fon or something like that it cost $3 it was nine pesos today the dollar to the pesos in the hundred three to one yeah three to one three to one I would cost me a dollar to take a taxi so everything that was nice about Argentina was the fact that the dollar was cheap and still the peso was pretty healthy but today you see the introduction of socialism you see the debasement of currency and truly the big thing that I see which is the big shell shock Factor based off of my study of history at this is that this cycle that Argentina went through of the debasement of currency the nationalization of privatized assets and the introduction of a socialist super vampire likee government isn't the first time that it happened in history I was talking with Andrew it happened in Korea it happened in Cuba uh it happened in Bolivia uh it happened in Venezuela you have a lot of countries where you have these socialist type governments that come in they leech everything from private citizens and they debase the currency by stealing everything now what happens because they steal everything they still have to get loans there's still debt to who most likely the IMF so what happens you have now the IMF being introduced into the scenario and they're quote unquote the bad guy but simultaneously they're the good guy so you don't know how to look at them because they're the ones that are putting you in debt and they're the ones that are pulling you added that back and forth back and forth back and forth like a loop cycle so here you have a socialist government that's most likely put in place you have a period of normalization of making sure that the government owns all the National Assets the airlines the the petrol companies the railways they own everything and but obviously we know that governments can't run [ __ ] because they're incompetent so these products these Goods these Services they become shitty now you have massive inflation not only do you have massive inflation you have massive debt that debt needs to get paid off so you have the introduction of a right-wing party right it can it happened uh with Bon it happened uh uh in probably the 40s and the 50s post World War II when the United States began to introduce the fight against communism so you had this introduction of right-wing kind of police States come in and my thesis is that these police these right-wing police States either have buou you have Malay you have different individuals their purpose is one very simple uh in my opinion it's the repayment to the IMF of all the debt so here you have a right Wing politician or somebody that's more on the liberal side that says okay we privatize we need to sell off all National Assets okay perfect what are you doing with that money you have to pay back the IMF [ __ ] like that's why you're here so create the entire inflation system prop a ton of debt then bring somebody through a police state can pay off that debt and then run the cycle back and forth back and forth back and forth my thesis was very simple and you're going to see it play out because uh I've been predicting the future for quite a bit of time now you're going to see it happen uh with people introducing third parties so no longer right-wing party leftwing party you'll have a third party emerge that'll be self-funded so you look at the president of Ecuador he's not rightwing leftwing he's a new guy that just emerged new party Malay not left wing rightwing new party and what happens young guys rightwing [ __ ] [ __ ] hate the old system but they still have to play the rules of the game because they're in debt who's going to pay off that debt the IMF so what I see is I look at these Cycles in these loops and I try to figure out where in the loop because it's happening these Jackal are happening where in the loop is this country or this stage and how can I succeed in it now before the introduction of right-wing police States or heavier Duty kind of controlled systems which I think right-wing uh governments tend to do more than leftwing governments if given too much control and they'll do it especially under the name of Safety and Security because remember Trump is the one that introduced the vaccine Trump is the one that introduced all the lockdowns and all these things whether it was his willpower his introduction doesn't really make a difference uh there's a prec that rightwing and I'm not any political party I'm just an observant from the sideline they int they tend to introduce more of police rule on the other side you have the other guys that introduce a lot of State Rule and they'll introduce a lot of hey the government is going to be your daddy and manage your things but in between here you have the narrative creation and the narrative creation is the pendulum swings either to the left or to the right and we've seen it you've probably witnessed it a pendulum swing at an energetic level moving to the right through history so the question is where do you position yourself uh to not get [ __ ] by these guys that are debasing the currency but simultaneously not being in a system where uh there may be right-wing police dat so when I left Argentina at the age of 16 it it was under the premise of there's a socialist culture that's coming and it wasn't that I knew that [ __ ] was going to hit the fan like how it went to become one of the most worthless countries in the world even though from one of the richest even though in 1890 it was one of the wealthiest countries in the planet I just left simply because in the US there was more opportunity and truly up until this day and I've been to 59 countries the United States is still the greatest country in the world hands down I I personally don't like the the left and the right and the uh Republican Democrat and the libertarian the Socialist the Comm like it's just like all these labels that nothing really neatly fits in there and I thought Malay actually called this out pretty well in one of the speeches where where I saw he said uh he talked about you know the left is socialist and the right is fascist he said but they're all collectivist they're all collectivist so in my book the uncon manifesto Shameless plug again talk about when I we actually draw a diagram of how all politics is on one side and on that there's a spectrum from left to right socialist to fascist but socialism and fascist although are on Extreme opposite ends apparently are all Central planners and collectivist ideas so all politics but isn't Bitcoin a collectivist idea at the same time no coin is the exact opposite but it has to work you have to have a collective unit of people for it to work well the what I'm talking about collectivist is Central planning okay so so somebody is planning the system versus what we said and I have a diagram I I'll get you a book when we're done here on the other side is capitalism is natural emergent it's individual individualism and Bitcoin fits over there and so you have sort of and and Malay called this out he said look all this you're you're leftwing you're socialist you're right-wing you're fascist he it's all collectivist he said we're bringing back the individual there is no State and so uh Frederick bastiat in the law talks about this there is no State it's no such thing as a state there's us as you and I as individuals and collectively we could agree to have this town or whatever this country and so I thought uh I thought it was a pretty good statement at at at a theoretical level yes it's cool but you still have billions of debt in debt that you have to pay Malay like you cool that sounds nice okay you still have to go and sit down with you you would rather him default on that I don't know because I don't really know uh what the best solution would be I think the best course of action right now at least for Argentina is the national is the is the privatization of National Assets there's no reason why the government should run anything yeah there's [ __ ] at everything and that seems like what he's trying to do yes and that's great the question is who do you sell it to the highest bidder and who's the highest bidder it's most likely all under yeah it's all under the table nationalization companies that come in and they they L go there's a book called confessions of uh economic Hitman of an economic Hitman he talks about the Jackal they come in and they give you an offer and if you don't take the offer so be it at the end of the day you have a guy that comes from a third party not leftwing rightwing a third party somebody has to fund that party 45% of argentines don't just vote for you because you have a message there's narratives there's pushed and because you see it in in in anywhere around the world in order for a message to be propagated it doesn't just naturally catch on you have to push a message and I think from Alternatives definitely the best alternative but do you think there's like sort sort of like a Zeitgeist at the time so for example the pendulum I think the pendulum doesn't swing from left to right I think this the pendulum swings from centralization to decentralization and I think it's technology that does that and that's a whole different conversation but if we look at the pendulum from that Viewpoint just for this exercise and you see this pendulum has been swinging towards centralization so we have the creation of the UN and the IMF and the bis and you know this Global us Le homogene Etc um but then we have like it's gone so far and now we're there's no truth and men are women and boys are girls and all these things and it's gone so far that people are rejecting that and you're seeing the Jordan Petersons and the Andrew Tates rising up in the face of that like people are starting to latch on to that and it seems like Malay Maloney over in Italy and Malay is just like one more person it seems like the whole world has been gas lit so hard and they've been told for so long that they don't matter that they're latching on to that type of a person yeah you it's it's the opposite of what you're already given so it's it's it's not an extreme it's just an extreme of that position I'm not saying it's good or bad it's just a natural pendulum swing but remember it's the pendulum swing of Technology we're talking about technological Freedom as soon as that technology gets suppressed or controlled you have censorship you want decentralization you have you need new technology that overtakes the centralization so you have centralization in the Federal Reserve in the banking system you need Bitcoin you have the centralization of the radio or the television you need the Internet so you have these pendulum swings now the objective is figuring out because of is law these pendulum swings get slower and they get faster and faster and faster and they go back and forth back and forth Freedom censorship Freedom censorship to the point where uh per the words of Ilia co-founder of open ey said AI has the ability to create imp perpetuity stable dictatorships and that's the freaky point where I'm like that's the scary Point that's the scary point and and he's true I agree with he's right bro he's right but I don't like that I don't like it at all but I'm like okay these are the freedom Pockets decentralized decentralized centralized decentralized we need to be capitalizing on these centralized Pockets before it goes back to say it doesn't matter how much Bitcoin you had if it doesn't matter how when Co locked down that [ __ ] locked down most people are [ __ ] that's that's the that's just the situation that people were in I don't care if you if you believed in it or you didn't believe in it your business if it was a physical business was closed down whether you got jabbed wore a mask didn't liked it didn't like it that was the outcome that was naturally happening but then you had the ability to make money online that was a pendulum s that was your freedom pocket dude the amount of money people made during Co online was crazy but the people physical brick and mortar no and now the pendulum swing of oh things open back up a ton of businesses started making a ton of money in person so you have these pendulum swings of of censorship decentralization censorship decentralization and it's capitalizing on these Pockets prior to being in a situation where you end up like China where now everything's credit controlled systems you everything's WeChat everything's face ID your Tesla needs to be uh under a certain credit score connected to your ID in order for you to charge the [ __ ] vehicle and and it's absolutely insane so I don't I don't know if Elon Musk using the X app now that has over 50 it has all 50 states the ability to remit money I don't know if he's going to create a super bank with X that's my opinion that's what I think he's going to do yeah but what happens when uh X becomes the the we chat the WeChat of the WeChat of of North America now you have the censorship that you're kind of going to be [ __ ] up on because you have the head of Technology that's always at the cusp of everything so you have this guy that runs your vehicle so he has probably the best understanding of public of Transport he has satellites that are shot into space he owns the AI that gets plugged into your brain he owns the rocket ships he owns the AI and he owns the social media platform that feeds the AI all he has to do is control a couple things and Sh gets really really intense really fast it's very scary so the goal is before these things get introduced which are obvious look at Skynet in r in China it's coming how can you create and utilize these pockets of decentralized wealth creation to not have to face the reality of living in these states so how can you I think building digital businesses outside of a specific ecosystem that is uh like Instagram or Facebook if you're limited to like one social platform or one specific Avenue uh it can be extremely difficult number two is you need something that is low-risk high reward and usually that comes from service based businesses so when you have to expend your life force energy to receive money so you're only expense if you don't have a lot of money is your time and your energy which isn't worth much because you don't you can't produce much so I think digital business is something that is scalable I think physical business uh service based businesses something that is lowrisk high reward that doesn't take a lot of startup cost and you need to build an AI proof business I met with one of the founders of open AI a couple years ago AI proof business or use AI use AI yes but so there's so with the AI boom took place you had a couple businesses you had the the the AI businesses that emerged and you had let's use a AI to beef up our business when I met with this guy a couple years ago he said build he like yeah AI is just a lot of things what you need to figure out is what can AI never replace or what is the hardest thing or the hardest moat for AI to replace so that's what you're going to build your business on it's the hardest mode that I can can can can not bypass which is what community personal development the things that AI can't do for things the things that AI can't do for you so I shifted Capital Club I shifted all my businesses to turn them not as AI companies but as AI proof companies my companies aren't crypto companies my cryp my companies are crypto-friendly companies so it's like as the narratives emerge and as the narratives change because I don't make any irreversible decisions I'm able to Pivot digital businesses uh lowrisk High reward which are basically service-based businesses because you're just contributing your time and labor uh low risk because you don't have to put up Capital so you can bootstrap them I agree with all that AI proof I mean sure you have the physical or you could use AI I mean you could could look at like I mean I think trying to become a lawyer or a doctor today like if you're starting your career now right you're going to you're going to go to college I'm going to go to college and be a doctor or a lawyer like man that's probably going to be replaced and and and this and that that the difficulty here is the fact that you're competing against an institutionalized establishment that not only has proven its inaccuracy and invalidity to be an institution like these big universities Harvard Yale all these things all we have to do dude is let's take every every single one of the presidents CEOs of all these top universities run all of their papers every single Paper essay a video conference every single presentation keynote that they've ever done and let's find plagiarism let's find plagiarism in their work and we discredit half of the [ __ ] universities automatically off rip yeah not only that but we also have to understand that the universities today are political weapons yeah they're not educational ins institutions they are political dogmatic government controlled ecosystems so when your entire narrative is you're the age of eight and your [ __ ] first grade teacher asks you what is your dream job not what do you want to not what do you want in life you know hey how was your day with your parents you know go respect your mom and your dad no what what is your dream job the moment you're born you're [ __ ] curated into the system and unless you unplug and wake up and realize that they're treading on you you're not going to tell him don't tread on me [ __ ] so you need to have this Enlightenment this this uh this wake up reality check dude yeah nobody was uh the the the I want to start my own online digital Community wasn't on my bingo card my little brother sells Pokemon Man cards online and makes good money like that wasn't on the choice right so to your point um yeah I love all that so let's go ahead and close it out here um so what's the uh what's the advice you said you can see the future or you see future Trends I don't want to say You can predict the future but you see these future Trends so you've already kind of laid that out so um fra frame it up for us one more time kind of close it out and and give us maybe let's frame it out let's frame it out specifically I actually wrote a medium article where I uh I in I think I posted it January 1 where I posted uh my predictions for 2024 so I created an article uh in three specific niches the your Commerce Niche your markets uh your money and markets Niche and then you're going to have your crypto which I think are going to be the three uh overlining narratives of 2024 so let me go ahead and pull this up through my eight months of research uh for 2024 I kind of put this into perspective so uh you can just type up 202 uh4 Luke Belmar predictions it's two-minute read we'll link it in the show Notes too uh so the in the beginning we have e-commerce so these are trends for 2024 the first one is e-commerce direct uh to Consumer Brands begin to receive a new wave of funding in private Equity Investments so if you look at 2021 20 22 private Equity when it comes to e-commerce tanked completely I I see another uh Resurgence of investments into IP and into brand and the e-commerce niches so for all these drop shippers all these white labelers begin to understand that there's going to be businesses that are going to be buying business which you I think they're going to be good to talk to you uh to get well positioned next is info products will begin to legitimize themselves and directly compete with universities and learning institutions so now why would I listen to uh this professor that's never been uh overseas about international business when I can go and sit down with somebody that has international business experience and just listen to them on YouTube yeah so now you have e-learning which has been like almost any phase of new technological advancement usually gets capitalized and captured by low interest and more predatory individuals so you look at 2017 2015 2014 crypto it was more scammy right because it's brand new there isn't real [ __ ] built on it it's the same thing with info products and e-learning the first people on the initial wave was the people that could milk the money off but today you have real real learning institutions online that are competing with the best of the best I see this as a trend in 2024 next is political themed e-commerce and Drop Shipping so all 2024 because it's an election year yes massive I made a ton of money selling a Donald Trump coin last uh election so it was just a coin that had Donald Trump's profile face and it was your memorabilia token and people bought a ton of it uh I think I think these do extremely well uh shout out to my radio show sponsor Universal coin and Buon they make a special Donald Trump gold coin uh so if you want to get an actual gold coin check out universal coin and so it's not that Drop Shipping coin yeah it's actually a real one next you have uh dominant influencers uh continue to build scale and sell IRL businesses so now you're going to begin to see influencers the likes of Mr Beast uh and the likes of Luke Belmar be in a situation whereby You're Building collateral businesses like the Nile river that we were talking about as proxy small Empires around your traffic source so I see a lot of on um content creators now no longer doing merch these simple kind of uh basic 101s of of Commerce but utilizing their audiences and building real products so now you can translate loyalty from here to loyalty here and once you have loyalty on the product you can sell that company yeah I love that uh now next is Health longevity and wellness becomes a top white hat month recurring Revenue e-commerce Niche so we uh I think it was um Universal talent agency or Universal talent management that manages all the top guys Gary Brea told me this he said they did a massive report as to what are the emerging Trends and niches and biohacking Longevity health and wellness and anti-aging were at the top over any other category in all of Commerce um so I see that being becoming super powerful next uh I'm big on Shopify so anytime Shopify keeps ramping up uh I love it money in markets uh the US continues spending nothing new there we already know it uh debt spiral boom everything uh that we already know Bitcoin ETF gets approved obviously this was written a couple days ago but now I see a big narrative towards ethereum ETF we are going to get an ethereum ETF eventually it is inevitable when you begin to look at all these big companies they all that Bitcoin is is a financial instrument where they can take a fee make some money and have market dominance why wouldn't do they do the same with ethereum and why wouldn't they do that the same with a basket of crypto assets they might so it's worth considering uh at least paying attention next you have your competing layer ones so you have uh salana you have avac you have these other kind of chains that people like to have highfrequency trading uh ecosystems take place so for example you have this whole shitcoin ecosystem which people like it hate it it's irrelevant it's a system that exists Bitcoin can't sustain that ecosystem because Bitcoin isn't designed for high frequency trading so now you see a lot of layer ones that are designed designed for people that want to buy $6 worth of something and it's only going to cost them a fraction of a penny there's a market for that I think that that's going to be one of the narratives uh that's going to be taking place when it comes to money and markets so anything that's layer ones that dominate with high frequency trading I think is going to be dope PayPal and Robin Hood stock super underperformed uh stocks I think now that the market begins to take uh form I think that there's a high likelihood that these stocks perform extremely well uh Venture Capital private equ Equity begins to invest into crypto infrastructure so a lot of companies that are risk adverse towards projects that have token allocations and tokens there's companies that will not touch this for legal purposes but they will still buy infrastructure in crypto they will still buy SAS in crypto so for Builders you don't necessarily need to launch a token you don't necessarily need to build something that what's already been built you can buil a crypto-friendly company that is of interest for people that are in the crypto space but that isn't tied to crypto specifically and shout out to my my fund Bitcoin opportunity fund we're investing in through the infrastructure of the Bitcoin ecosystem perfect so now you have the the the example right so now you can invest not in tokens but in projects that sustain the crypto ecosystem I see a massive narrative there for crypto and defi uh def defi platforms shift Focus to reducing retail onboarding friction and begin to compete head on with centralized exchanges so you have the likes of Jupiter exchange or Phantom wallet if I if I was to show you Phantom wallet right now I download the Phantom wallet in 30 seconds I open up Jupiter exchange somebody sends me usdc and I'm trading in 10 minutes for me to open up a Robin Hood account get kyc fund it connect a connect my card get it funded buy some Bitcoin takes a long time I see defi very soon competing hand head on handhand with centralized exchanges with your Weebles with your e trades with your amerit trades defi is getting really really crazy and it's getting really really well funded uh so I'd be looking at these uh nfts with high viral IP become multi-billion dollar Brands so nfts are m nearly your ability to uh hold on to a percentage or a piece of a company or be part of a community companies that have high value IP that can merge into the real world are going to do extremely well you have the likes of pudy penguins you have a couple other companies that are doing extremely well uh these are worth considering and looking into only if they have real world applications you look at the likes of you talked about Pokemon right Pokemon that's IP so you're not investing in Pokemon cards you're investing into the IP that gives the Pokemon Cards value and I think that that's one of these narratives that's going to be taking place uh next is tokenized assets under management so I see a big play uh Larry f begins uh and has been talking about the tokenization of all real world assets everything real estate mortgages uh your bank statements your car loan your house anything is going to be tokenized so companies that begin to build portfolios or begin to take money in to manage Assets in a tokenized format I think are be become extremely popular next we have more publicly traded companies begin to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets I think now that you had this Reporting System kind of update my companies have Bitcoin in their balance sheet it's never going to it's never going to leave I think more public listed companies are going to begin adopting it I think that's going to be huge and then uh one of the big ones is layer one smart contracts focused on Parallel execution of the evm which is the ethereum virtual machine become popular so this is basically uh l1s or different projects that allow ethereum to operate like a piece of [ __ ] because right now it operates like a piece of [ __ ] and then finally the big one for the end of the year is the middle class officially gets priced out of buying one full Bitcoin certainly a few of those are going to play out sounds pretty good sounds pretty ambitious all right well man we've covered a lot of ground I think that's probably a good place to break break it off thanks for having me bu that's what we'll focus on for next year position yourself in one of those areas um if I'm going to summarize this for people listening um focus on yourself work for free so you can build a skill deliver the skill to the to the marketplace for free until someone wants to pay you for it once you've created that wealth um learn to control where you work and when you work um and then parlay that money into some places that you can multiply that wealth um here's a whole bunch of themes that you can do this um and continue to build your wealth and grow your wealth and then protect it so you can protect your freedom and sovereignty can I mention how the protection real quick the prot C I divide it into two things and this is kind of a left a left kind of curveball it has nothing to do with yourself it has to do with the people you bring so to preserve your wealth you need a wealth you need a you need you need a financial advisor a financial planner you can't assume that just because like you said just because you're good in one business doesn't mean you're good in every business and just because you're good at making money doesn't mean you're good at keeping it yeah so in my life the first thing I did as soon as I began to make a little bit of money I found a financial ad ADV visor or a financial planner that had my risk appetite or understood my risk appetite and could help me position a portfolio whether it was a mentor whether it was a somebody that's a CPA and actually specialized in this I have found these people next is a financial role model so if I want to preserve my wealth I need to look at somebody that's been able to do this model prior and take from them right so take from their ingredients take from their recipes and put something together for me take the likes of Warren Buffett Warren Buffett has his principles of uh if you're too Diversified you're ignorant right box yeah so so or if you invest everything into one you're putting both feet into the into the lake too much risk so somewhere within there is his financial model of wealth preservation you need to find who kind of aligns with you learn from them become mentored by them find a financial adviser that can help you manage this area which is very different than making money and being an entrepreneur and I think having uh advisers having counsel and having people that do this management in store for me and kind of think about the future of what I've already built have been able to position me for the preservation of wealth yeah awesome well with that we'll sign it off thank you Belmar thank you for having me Mark Moss such a pleasure likewise see you all right that's a wrap hopefully you've enjoyed this interview I did with Luke Belmar boy I know he's young but don't overlook his accomplishments because of his age there's a wealth of wisdom that we can all learn because we can learn from anything and anybody but specifically we can learn from somebody who came from nothing and made that much money make sure to give him a follow check out all his links down below also like I said join me live as we talk about how we're going to navigate what's happening with our Central Bank and our government and really about the world I'm going to show you all the charts the graphs how we should be building our portfolios to deal with this so we can survive and thrive 2024 without dealing with all the volatility there's a link down below come join me that's what I got hope you enjoyed it to your success I'm out\n"
